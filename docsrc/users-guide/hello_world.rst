"Hello, World!"
---------------

Fitting a Stan model using the NUTS-HMC sampler
***********************************************

In order to verify the installation and also to demonstrate
the CmdStanPy workflow, we use CmdStanPy to fit the
the example Stan model ``bernoulli.stan``
to the dataset ``bernoulli.data.json``.
The ``bernoulli.stan`` is a `Hello, World! <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program>`__
program which illustrates the basic syntax of the Stan language.
It allows the user to verify that CmdStanPy, CmdStan,
the StanC compiler, and the C++ toolchain have all been properly installed.

For substantive example models and
guidance on coding statistical models in Stan, see
the `Stan User's Guide <https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/index.html>`_.


The Stan model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The model ``bernoulli.stan``  is a trivial model:
given a set of N observations of i.i.d. binary data
`y[1] ... y[N]`, it calculates the Bernoulli chance-of-success `theta`.

.. code:: stan

    data {
      int<lower=0> N;
      int<lower=0,upper=1> y[N];
    }
    parameters {
      real<lower=0,upper=1> theta;
    }
    model {
      theta ~ beta(1,1);  // uniform prior on interval 0,1
      y ~ bernoulli(theta);
    }

The :class:`CmdStanModel` class manages the Stan program and its corresponding compiled executable.
It provides properties and functions to inspect the model code and filepaths.
A `CmdStanModel` can be instantiated from a Stan file or its corresponding compiled executable file.

.. ipython:: python

    # import packages
    import os
    from cmdstanpy import CmdStanModel

    # specify Stan program file
    stan_file = os.path.join('users-guide', 'examples', 'bernoulli.stan')

    # instantiate the model object
    model = CmdStanModel(stan_file=stan_file)

    # inspect model object
    print(model)

    # inspect compiled model
    print(model.exe_info())



Data inputs
^^^^^^^^^^^

CmdStanPy accepts input data either as a Python dictionary which maps data variable names
to values, or as the corresponding JSON file.

The bernoulli model requires two inputs: the number of observations `N`, and
an N-length vector `y` of binary outcomes.
The data file `bernoulli.data.json` contains the following inputs:

.. code::

   {
    "N" : 10,
    "y" : [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]
   }



Fitting the model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :meth:`~CmdStanModel.sample` method is used to do Bayesian inference
over the model conditioned on data using  using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
(HMC) sampling. It runs Stan's HMC-NUTS sampler on the model and data and
returns a :class:`CmdStanMCMC` object.  The data can be specified
either as a filepath or a Python dictionary; in this example, we use the
example datafile `bernoulli.data.json`:
By default, the `sample` method runs 4 sampler chains.


.. ipython:: python

    # specify data file
    data_file = os.path.join('users-guide', 'examples', 'bernoulli.data.json')

    # fit the model
    fit = model.sample(data=data_file)

Underlyingly, the CmdStan outputs are a set of per-chain
`Stan CSV files <https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/stan-csv.html#mcmc-sampler-csv-output>`__.
The filenames follow the template '<model_name>-<YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>-<chain_id>'
plus the file suffix '.csv'.
CmdStanPy also captures the per-chain console and error messages.
The ``output_dir`` argument is an optional argument which specifies
the path to the output directory used by CmdStan.
If this argument is omitted, the output files are written
to a temporary directory which is deleted when the current Python session is terminated.

.. ipython:: python

    # printing the object reports sampler commands, output files
    print(fit)


Accessing the results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``sample`` method returns a :class:`CmdStanMCMC` object,
which provides access to the information from the Stan CSV files.
The CSV header and data rows contain the outputs from each iteration of the sampler.
CSV comment blocks are used to report the inference engine configuration and timing information.
The NUTS-HMC adaptive sampler algorithm also outputs the per-chain HMC tuning parameters step_size and metric.

The ``CmdStanMCMC`` object parses the set of Stan CSV files into separate in-memory data structures for
the set of sampler iterations, the metadata, and the step_size and metric and provides accessor methods for each.
The primary object of interest are the draws from all iterations of the sampler, i.e., the CSV data rows.
The ``CmdStanMCMC`` methods allow the user to extract the sample in whatever data format is needed for their analysis.
The sample can be extracted in tabular format, either as

+ a numpy.ndarray: :meth:`~CmdStanMCMC.draws`

+ a pandas.DataFrame: :meth:`~CmdStanMCMC.draws_pd`

.. ipython:: python

    print(fit.draws().shape)
    print(fit.draws(concat_chains=True).shape)
    fit.draws_pd()

The sample can be treated as a collection of named, structured variables.
CmdStanPy makes a distinction between the per-iteration model outputs
and the per-iteration algorithm outputs:  the former are 'stan_variables'
and the information reported by the sampler are 'method_variables'.
Accessor functions extract these as:

+ a structured numpy.ndarray: :meth:`~CmdStanMCMC.stan_variable`
  which contains the set of all draws in the sample for the named Stan program variable.
  The draws from all chains are flattened, i.e.,
  the first ndarray dimension is the number of draws X number of chains.
  The remaining ndarray dimensions correspond to the Stan program variable dimension.

+ an xarray.Dataset: :meth:`~CmdStanMCMC.draws_xr`

+ a Python dict mapping Stan variable names to numpy.ndarray objects, where the
  chains are flattened, as above:
  :meth:`~CmdStanMCMC.stan_variables`.

+ a Python dict mapping the algorithm outputs to numpy.ndarray objects.
  Because these outputs are used for within-chain and cross-chain diagnostics,
  they are not flattened.
  :meth:`~CmdStanMCMC.stan_variables`.


.. ipython:: python

    print(fit.stan_variable('theta'))
    print(fit.draws_xr('theta'))
    for k, v in fit.stan_variables().items():
        print(f'{k}\t{v.shape}')
    for k, v in fit.method_variables().items():
        print(f'{k}\t{v.shape}')


In addition to the MCMC sample itself, the CmdStanMCMC object provides
access to the the per-chain HMC tuning parameters from the NUTS-HMC adaptive sampler,
(if present).

.. ipython:: python

    print(fit.metric_type)
    print(fit.metric)
    print(fit.step_size)



The CmdStanMCMC object also provides access to metadata about the model and the sampler run.

.. ipython:: python

    print(fit.metadata.cmdstan_config['model'])
    print(fit.metadata.cmdstan_config['seed'])

    print(fit.metadata.stan_vars_cols.keys())
    print(fit.metadata.method_vars_cols.keys())




CmdStan utilities:  ``stansummary``, ``diagnose``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CmdStan is distributed with a posterior analysis utility
`stansummary <https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/stansummary.html>`__
that reads the outputs of all chains and computes summary statistics
for all sampler and model parameters and quantities of interest.
The :class:`CmdStanMCMC` method :meth:`~CmdStanMCMC.summary` runs this utility and returns
summaries of the total joint log-probability density **lp__** plus
all model parameters and quantities of interest in a pandas.DataFrame:

.. ipython:: python

    fit.summary()


CmdStan is distributed with a second posterior analysis utility
`diagnose <https://mc-stan.org/docs/cmdstan-guide/diagnose.html>`__
which analyzes the per-draw sampler parameters across all chains
looking for potential problems which indicate that the sample
isn't a representative sample from the posterior.
The :meth:`~CmdStanMCMC.diagnose` method runs this utility and prints the output to the console.

.. ipython:: python

    print(fit.diagnose())



Managing Stan CSV files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :class:`CmdStanMCMC` object keeps track of all output files produced
by the sampler run.
The :meth:`~CmdStanMCMC.save_csvfiles` function moves the CSV files
to a specified directory.

.. ipython:: python
    :verbatim:

    fit.save_csvfiles(dir='some/path')
